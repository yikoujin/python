Check out this great No starch Press@humble deal for some awesome python titles!
You may even recognize some of the author names from their talks at#PyConUS2022

Applications:
Python is used in many application domains.Here's a sampling.
The Python Package Index lists thousands of third party modules for Python.

üò¢Web and Internet Development
Python offers many choices for web development:

Frameworks such as Django and Pyramid.
Micro-frameworks such as Django and Pyramid.
Advanced content management systems such as Plone and django CMS.

Python's standard library suppots many Internet protocols:

HTML and XML
JSON
E-mail processing.
Support for FTP,IMAP,and other Interent protocols.
Easy-to-usse socket interface.

And the Package Index has yet more libraries:
Requests:a powerful HTTP client library.
Beautiful Soap:an HTML parser that can handle all sorts of oddball HTML.
Feedparser:for parsing RSS/Atom feeds.
Paramiko:implementing the SSH2 protocol.
Twisted Python:a framework for asynchronous network praogramming.


Scientific and Numeric
python is widely used in scientific and numeric computing:

Scipy is collection of packages for mathematics,science,and engineering.
Pandas is a data analysis and modeling libarary.PandasÊòØ‰∏Ä‰∏™Êï∞ÊçÆÂàÜÊûêÂíåÂª∫Ê®°Â∫ì„ÄÇ
IPython is a powerful interactive shell that features easy editing and recording of
a work session,and supports visualization and parallel computing.

Education
Python is a superb language for teachig programming,both at the introductory level and in more
advanced courses.


Books such as How to Think like a Computer  Scientist,Python Programming:An Introduction to Computer
Science,and Practical Programming.
The Education Special Interest Group is a good place to discuss teaching issues.

Desktop GUIs
The Tk GUI library is included with most binary distributions of Python.
Some tookits that are usable on several platforms are avalable seperately:

wxWidgets
Kivy,for writing multitouch applications.
Qt via pyqt or pyside
Platform-specific toolkits are also available:
GTK+
Microsoft Foundation Classes through the win32 extensions


Software Development
Python is often used as a support language for software developers,
for build control and managemtn,testing,and in many other ways.

SCons for build control
